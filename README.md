# Java Instance Classes: Utilizing Different Return Types

Welcome to the Java Instance Classes repository! This project exemplifies the usage of different return types - `void` and `String` - within instance classes to perform actions and return values.

## Description

In this project, we delve into the versatility of return types in Java instance classes. The `Computer` class showcases a method `music()` that returns `void`, allowing it to play music without returning any value. On the other hand, the `BuyPen` class exhibits a method `pen(int cost)` that returns a `String`, indicating the decision to buy a pen based on its cost.

## Usage

To explore this project:

1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
4. Compile the Java files using the command:
5. Run the compiled program using the command:
6. Witness the demonstration of using `void` and `String` return types in Java instance classes.

## Features

- **Versatility**: Learn how to utilize different return types (`void` and `String`) in Java instance classes for performing actions and returning values.
- **Illustration**: Understand the concept of return types through practical examples with the `Computer` and `BuyPen` classes.
- **Flexibility**: Gain insights into the flexibility and applicability of return types in Java programming.
