# Java-Action-With-Void-and-String
This Java project demonstrates instance classes with methods returning void and String types. The Computer class has a music() method for playing music, and the BuyPen class features a pen(int cost) method to decide on pen purchase based on cost. This illustrates the flexibility of return types in Java instance classes.
